            "This painting is considered to be Bellotto's first view of Dresden. Sitting at the centre before the city backdrop is a draughtsman who can only be Bellotto himself. An older man in a green coat points out the painting's subject to Bellotto, while a second man with a round, reddened head stands behind him to the left. No historical sources exist to help us identify these and the figures further to the right, but tradition has it that the more corpulent figure is the court painter Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, who was simultaneously inspector of the Königliche Gemäldegalerie, and that the older man is Johann Alexander Thiele, Bellotto's predecessor as vedutista at the court of Dresden. The gentlemen further to the right have been identified as the royal physician Filippo di Violante, the corpulent countertenor Niccolò Pozzi (known as Niccolini), one of the court Turks, and — standing slightly apart — the court-jester Fröhlich. Only the last can be definitively identified, for he is known from contemporary illustrations that show him wearing the costume of the Salzkammergut region of Austria.The painting has a pendant, assuredly the most famous view of Dresden, which is taken from the same side of the Elbe but from a point further downstream, below the Augustusbrücke. That composition, dating from 1748, more or less mirrors the work on view here so that the diagonal course of the river in the two pictures is symmetrically arranged.\nThe painting has a pendant, assuredly the most famous view of Dresden, which is taken from the same side of the Elbe but from a point further downstream, below the Augustusbrücke.

According to the reconstruction accepted by many scholars, the altarpiece consisted of a Virgin and Child in the centre (Brooklyn Museum, New York), St Augustin (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg) at the left, and probably St Nicholas (lost) at the right. The three predella panels are the Departure of St Augustin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (Pinacoteca Stuard, Parma), and the Birth of St Nicholas (Kunstmuseum, Basel).",

            "Minne modelled his sculptures in clay and had them cast in plaster. After this, they were worked out in bronze, stone or wood, mostly on order from abroad. He received his most important commission from the German collector Karl Ernst Osthaus, who called on Henry Van de Velde for the construction and furnishing of the Osthaus Museum in Hagen. In addition to various other sculptures, Minne produced his principal work for the entrance hall of the Osthaus Museum: the Fountain of Kneeling Youths, in which he repeated the figure of the kneeling boy around a circular basin. He showed designs for this fountain from 1899 in a succession of exhibitions. The only surviving model in plaster is in the Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent; the final version in marble (1905) is in the Folkwang Museum, Essen. The Osthaus Museum (now Folkwang Museum) in Hagen has a replica of the fountain in the main hall. Later, bronze versions were executed and set up in public places.The picture shows the original marble version in the Folkwang Museum, Essen.\nThe picture shows the original marble version in the Folkwang Museum, Essen.",

            "Frescoes in the oratories of brotherhoods are found throughout Italy. In 1516 to 1518 the Sienese brotherhood of Mary and Bernardino commissioned Girolamo del Pacchia, Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi to fresco the walls of their oratory with a cycle on the life of Mary, The artists painted two stories each: Pacchia, the Birth of Mary and the Annunciation; Sodoma, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation of Mary; and Beccafumi, the Betrothal of Mary and the Death of the Virgin. The missing scenes on the right-hand longitudinal wall, the Visitation and the Assumption of the Virgin were not painted by Sodoma until the late 1520s, and Baccafumi's altarpiece still later, between 1535 and 1537. The cycle begins on the left wall (The Birth of Mary to THe Betrothal of Mary), and continues above the altar wall (Annunciation) and the right longitudinal wall (Visitation to Assumption of the Virgin) through the second of the short walls (The Coronation of Mary). In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls.",
